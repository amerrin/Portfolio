*See the wiki for full documentation.*
=
*Run the Server.java file from the ServerClient package.*
=
When running, start classes through the server's GUI panel that has buttons for each manager.
=
We found it easiest to import the folder into a new 'Java Project' in eclipse.  Make sure to import into the 'src' folder.
=
Running Non-Normative Cases
=
Non-Normative cases can be found on 2 different panels within the program.  The user needs to run the 'LaneManager' and 'KitManager' from the Server Panel that opens when 'Server.java' is run.
On these panels, the menu bar is located in the upper left corner of the program.  Due to some conflict with eclipse the bar does not appear and needs to be clicked to be displayed.
Simply choose 'Switch View' to switch the view.

When to run non-normatives
  Nest Missing Parts:
    Remove Parts From Nest - Run when a nest is filling up and the next time a picture is going to be taken, the non-norm will run.
    Jam Lane - Run before a lane starts running.
    Feeder Diverts too slow - Run before a feeder diverts and the next diversion will not work.
    
  Nest Bad:
    Make Parts Bad - Run When there are parts in the nest before a picture is taken.
    Make the Parts Pile on top of each other - Run when the parts get into a nest, before a picture is taken.
    Make the Parts Unstable - Same as above
    Parts Robot In Front Of Camera - Run before a nest fills up and the next time a picture is taken the nest will empty.
  Kit non-norm:
    Make Bad Kit - Run before a kit is made and the next kit will be tested for the non-normative.
